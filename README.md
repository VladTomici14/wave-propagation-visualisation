## Introduction 
The project is written in Python. But itâ€™s running in a Google Colab.

### Why Google Colab? 
Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) is a cloud-based platform provided by Google that allows users to write, execute, and share Python code in a web-based environment. It is particularly well-suited for tasks involving data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing, as it provides free access to computational resources such as GPUs and TPUs.

Google Colab eliminates the need for extensive local setup by enabling code execution directly in the cloud. This means that users do not need to install Python or additional libraries on their local machines, as all dependencies can be specified and installed within the Colab notebook. Furthermore, Colab notebooks are easily shareable via links, making collaboration and distribution of code straightforward.

In the context of this project, I chose Google Colab because it ensures that my wave plotting code can be accessed and run seamlessly anywhere, anytime by anyone, without requiring any configuration of the project on local machines. By hosting the code on Colab, I can provide a ready-to-run environment where the project can be executed interactively, enhancing both accessibility and user experience.
